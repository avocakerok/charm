Upcoming release:

* Changed API of the following functions to read/write spherical harmonic 
  coefficients from/to files:

    * "charm_shc_read_bin",
    * "charm_shc_read_gfc",
    * "charm_shc_read_mtx",
    * "charm_shc_read_tbl",
    * "charm_shc_write_bin",
    * "charm_shc_write_mtx",
    * "charm_shc_write_tbl".

  Previously, it was necessary to open the stream for the input/output file, 
  call the CHarm function to read/write the coefficients and, finally, close 
  the stream.  All these steps had to be done by the user.  Now, the user only 
  calls the function to read/write the coefficients and specifies the file's 
  path name as one of the input parameters.  Opening and closing the stream is 
  done by CHarm.

  This should considerably simplify making the Python wrapper, given than 
  wrapping "TYPE *" pointer with "ctypes" is not that trivial.

* Two members, "nc" and "ns", were added to the "charm_shc" structure to 
  represent the total number of spherical harmonic coefficients "Cnm" and 
  "Snm", respectively.  This has no effect on API.

CHarm 0.1.2:

* Bug fix for incorrectly included c-file instead of its respective header file 
  in "integ_cc.c".  The bug was introduced in CHarm 0.1.0.

CHarm 0.1.1:

* A few typo fixes in docs on installing.

CHarm 0.1.0:

* Added support for AVX, AVX2 and AVX-512 vector CPU instructions.

* Bug fix in synthesis of point/mean values at grids having only a single 
  point/cell in the longitudinal direction ("shs_point_grd.c", 
  "shs_cell_grd.c").  The same bug fix applies to the analysis of area-mean 
  values ("sha_cell.c") and the synthesis of area-mean values on irregular 
  surfaces ("shs_cell_isurf.c").  Each of the routines returned an error before 
  the computation could start.

* Removed some functions from API that bring little added value to the users 
  ("charm_misc_is_nearly_equal", "charm_misc_arr_min", "charm_misc_arr_max", 
  "charm_misc_arr_mean", "charm_misc_arr_std", "charm_misc_arr_rms", 
  "charm_misc_arr_chck_lin_incr" and "charm_misc_arr_chck_symm").

CHarm 0.0.1:

* Fixed data-sharing bug in "shs_cell_isurf_coeffs.c".

CHarm 0.0.0:

* Initial release
