Upcoming release:

* Added support for AVX, AVX2 and AVX-512 vector CPU instructions.

* Bug fix in synthesis of point/mean values at grids having only a single 
  point/cell in the longitudinal direction ("shs_point_grd.c", 
  "shs_cell_grd.c").  The same bug fix applies to the analysis of area-mean 
  values ("sha_cell.c") and the synthesis of area-mean values on irregular 
  surfaces ("shs_cell_isurf.c").  Each of the routines returned an error before 
  the computation could start.

CHarm 0.0.1:

* Fixed data-sharing bug in "shs_cell_isurf_coeffs.c".

CHarm 0.0.0:

* Initial release
