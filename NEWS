CHarm 0.1.2:

* Bug fix for incorrectly included c-file instead of its respective header file 
  in "integ_cc.c".  The bug was introduced in CHarm 0.1.0.

CHarm 0.1.1:

* A few typo fixes in docs on installing.

CHarm 0.1.0:

* Added support for AVX, AVX2 and AVX-512 vector CPU instructions.

* Bug fix in synthesis of point/mean values at grids having only a single 
  point/cell in the longitudinal direction ("shs_point_grd.c", 
  "shs_cell_grd.c").  The same bug fix applies to the analysis of area-mean 
  values ("sha_cell.c") and the synthesis of area-mean values on irregular 
  surfaces ("shs_cell_isurf.c").  Each of the routines returned an error before 
  the computation could start.

* Removed some functions from API that bring little added value to the users 
  ("charm_misc_is_nearly_equal", "charm_misc_arr_min", "charm_misc_arr_max", 
  "charm_misc_arr_mean", "charm_misc_arr_std", "charm_misc_arr_rms", 
  "charm_misc_arr_chck_lin_incr" and "charm_misc_arr_chck_symm").

CHarm 0.0.1:

* Fixed data-sharing bug in "shs_cell_isurf_coeffs.c".

CHarm 0.0.0:

* Initial release
