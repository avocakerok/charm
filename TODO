* Add unit tests for PyHarm.

* Add note in docs that "sudo make install" installs PyHarm as a root, too, 
  even if in virtual environment.  It seems that the uninstallation must then 
  be manual instead of using just "pip uninstall pyharm".  For now, the best 
  solution therefore seems to be to install both CHarm and PyHarm either as 
  a user or as a root and not combine the two.

* Add support for fused multiply-add instructions.

* Add the Condon--Shortley phase factor.

* Add other normalization schemes.

* Check coordinates for the [-pi / 2, pi / 2] and [0, 2 * pi] intervals in sha 
  and shs functions.

* Add a global variable to control the verbosity.

* Parallelize "leg_pnmj_coeffs.c".

* Alternatively build CHarm with CMake on Windows.
