Installation on Windows 10
==========================

Perhaps the easiest way is to install the `Windows Subsystem for Linux
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux>`_ (WSL).  WSL
offers a fully functional Linux distribution that you can run from within
Windows 10 (no dual boot).  WSL is officially supported by Microsoft and its
installation is very easy.  Having installed WSL, you may proceed with
:ref:`installation_unix`.

Other good solution is, for instance, `Cygwin
