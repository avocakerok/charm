This chapter provides an installation guide for Unix-based operating systems.
On other operating systems, the library should compile, too, but, for the time 
being, a detailed recipe is missing.  Nonetheless, provided are some hints for
:ref:`installation_win`.

Start by downloading the :ref:`download` from GitHub in any way you like and 
then enter the main directory of CHarm.  For instance,

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/blazej-bucha/charm
  cd charm

The installation steps that follow depend on the operating system, on which 
your machine is running.
