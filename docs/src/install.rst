PyHarm (the Python wrapper) can either be installed via ``pip`` or it can be 
build from source.  Users having no or little experience with compiling from 
the command line are advised to use ``pip``.  Advanced users are recommended to 
build from source.  This gives you the freedom to tailor PyHarm to your CPU 
which is likely to improve the performance compared to the generic binaries 
installed by ``pip``.

CHarm (the C library) has to be build from source.
