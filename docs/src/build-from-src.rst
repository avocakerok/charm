====================
Building from source
====================

This chapter will guide you through building from source on Unix-based 
operating systems.  On other operating systems, the library should compile, 
too, but a detailed recipe is missing for the time being.  Nonetheless, 
provided are some hints for :ref:`build_from_src_non_unix`.

Start by downloading the :ref:`download` from GitHub in any way you like and 
then enter the main directory of CHarm.  For instance,

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/blazej-bucha/charm
  cd charm

The installation steps that follow depend on your operating system.
