Introduction
============

CHarm is a C library to work with spherical harmonics up to almost arbitrarily
high degrees.


Features
========

* Supports real-valued fully-normalized surface and solid spherical harmonics
  (the geodetic norm).

* Performs FFT-based surface spherical harmonic analysis and solid spherical
  harmonic synthesis with minimized memory requirements.

* Stable up to high degrees and orders (tens of thousands and beyond).

* Available in single, double and quadruple precision.

* Supports point and mean data values (both analysis and synthesis).

* Supports synthesis at grids and at scattered points/cells.  Synthesis at
  grids is done by efficient FFT-based algorithms if possible.  For grids,
  where FFT cannot be used, applied are the Chebyshev recurrences along the
  latitude parallels.

* Supports the Gauss--Legendre and Driscoll--Healy quadratures.

* Integrates solid spherical harmonic expansions (e.g., of the gravitational
  potential) on band-limited irregular surfaces (e.g., on the Earth's
  surface). [#f1]_

* Computes Fourier coefficients of fully-normalized associated Legendre
  functions of the first kind up to ultra-high harmonic degrees.

* Supports `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org/>`_ parallelization for
  shared-memory architectures.

* Supports AVX, AVX2 and AVX-512 SIMD CPU intructions to improve the 
  performance.

* Performs discrete FFT by `FFTW <http://www.fftw.org/>`_.

.. [#f1] This routine is unique to CHarm.

Documentation
=============

The documentation of the latest version from the ``develop`` branch is 
available at `https://blazej-bucha.github.io/charm/index.html  
<https://blazej-bucha.github.io/charm/index.html>`_.

A pre-compiled HTML documentation is also available in ``docs/build/html`` or 
it can be built by executing ``make docs`` (requires ``doxygen`` and Python 
modules ``sphinx``, ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` and ``breathe``).  PDF and other 
versions of the documentation can also be built (outside the installation 
system) as ``cd docs && make -f Makefile-sphinx latexpdf``, etc.
